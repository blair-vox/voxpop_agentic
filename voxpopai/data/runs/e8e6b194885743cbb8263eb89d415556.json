  "area": null,
  "domain": "civic-policy",
  "summary": "- Strong resistance to the proposal due to concerns about increased street congestion, potential property devaluation, and negative impacts on the local economy.\n- Consistent emphasis on the need for balanced approaches that consider the needs of residents, including maintaining minimum parking requirements and improving public transport options.\n- Differing perspectives on the potential benefits of reducing car dependency, with some supporting the policy for environmental reasons and others highlighting the challenges residents may face with inadequate parking solutions.",

My concern is that this could lead to a shortage of parking spaces, causing significant congestion on our local streets. As a Bondi resident, I've seen the area become increasingly populated. Even though I don't drive, I know that many of my neighbours and their visitors do. They already struggle to find parking, and this could worsen the problem. Furthermore, our public transport system is not robust enough to be a viable alternative for most people. While I understand the environmental benefit of reducing car usage, I believe it's more effective to invest in enhancing our public transport system and promoting its benefits to residents.",
