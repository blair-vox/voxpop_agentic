  "question": "We want to build an ai person based focus group. What do you feel about the word 'synthetic' to describe the personas? If you don't like it what would you suggest?",
  "area": null,
  "summary": "- The most salient theme is the emphasis on authenticity and transparency in language used to describe personas in AI focus groups, with participants consistently suggesting terms like \"simulated\" or \"virtual\" over \"synthetic\" to better reflect human experiences.\n- There is a conflict between participants who see the term \"synthetic\" as fitting and accurate for these AI-generated personas and those who find it artificial and impersonal, highlighting differing perspectives on the terminology used in such contexts.\n- A surprising observation is the consistent importance placed on terminology accuracy and the impact it has on participants' perceptions of the authenticity and credibility of the personas involved in the focus groups.",
