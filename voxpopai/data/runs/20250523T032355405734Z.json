      "response": "NARRATIVE:\nAs a resident in Bondi Junction, I strongly support the proposal to remove minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments. Bondi is already bustling with traffic, and reducing the need for car spaces can help alleviate congestion and promote more sustainable modes of transport like walking, cycling, and public transit. Besides, many young people like me prefer to live in areas with good access to amenities and public transport, rather than relying on cars. This change could make housing more affordable and environmentally friendly, aligning with my concerns about global warming and the environment.\n\nSURVEY:\nSupport Level (1-5): 5\nImpact – Housing (1-5): 4\nImpact – Transport (1-5): 5\nImpact – Community (1-5): 3\nKey Concerns: Traffic congestion, Environmental sustainability\nSuggested Improvements: Ensure adequate public transport options, Provide incentives for car-sharing programs",

Parking availability is crucial for residents' quality of life, especially in areas where public transport may not be as accessible or reliable.
