      "response": "NARRATIVE:\nI strongly oppose the proposal to remove minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi. As a resident who values easy access to parking, I believe this change would worsen the already congested parking situation in the area. Additionally, without designated parking spaces, visitors and residents alike would struggle to find parking, leading to increased frustration and potentially impacting the sense of community in Bondi.\n\nSURVEY:\nSupport Level (1-5): 1\nImpact – Housing (1-5): 2\nImpact – Transport (1-5): 3\nImpact – Community (1-5): 4\nKey Concerns: Parking availability, Community cohesion\nSuggested Improvements: Implement a comprehensive parking strategy, Consult residents for input on parking needs",
