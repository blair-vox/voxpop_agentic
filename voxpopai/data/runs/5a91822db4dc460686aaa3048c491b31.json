The library provides me with a quiet place to read and learn, while the parks offer a great place for a jog or a picnic. The community centre is a fantastic spot where I can connect with my neighbours and attend various activities. However, I believe there is room for improvement. The library could benefit from extended opening hours and more resources, particularly for adults seeking further education. The parks could have better maintenance and more facilities like outdoor gyms. Lastly, the community centre could offer more programs to engage the youth and to provide support for residents who are struggling with the cost of living.",
