      "response": "NARRATIVE:\nAs a Bellevue Hill resident with a high income and a strong focus on environmental issues, I fully support the removal of minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi. Encouraging car-free or car-light living aligns with my values of reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable urban planning. This policy could lead to more walkable neighborhoods, reduced traffic congestion, and increased use of public transport, all of which are crucial for combating global warming and creating a greener future.\n\nSURVEY:\nSupport Level (1-5): 5\nImpact – Housing (1-5): 4\nImpact – Transport (1-5): 5\nImpact – Community (1-5): 4\nKey Concerns: Environmental impact, Walkability\nSuggested Improvements: Ensure adequate public transport options, Promote car-sharing initiatives",
