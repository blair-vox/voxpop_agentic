      "response": "NARRATIVE:\nAs someone who values the environment and understands the importance of reducing car dependency, I strongly support the proposal to remove minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi. Encouraging alternative modes of transport like walking, cycling, and public transport not only reduces congestion and improves air quality but also aligns with my belief in sustainable urban planning. Additionally, this policy could potentially lower housing costs by eliminating the need to allocate space for car parking, making living in Bondi more affordable for young professionals like myself.\n\nSURVEY:\nSupport Level (1-5): 5\nImpact – Housing (1-5): 4\nImpact – Transport (1-5): 5\nImpact – Community (1-5): 4\nKey Concerns: Housing affordability, Sustainable urban planning\nSuggested Improvements: Ensure adequate infrastructure for alternative transport modes, Provide incentives for car-sharing programs",
