      "response": "NARRATIVE:\nAs a resident in Maroubra, I strongly oppose the proposal to remove minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi. Parking is already a nightmare in our area, and reducing parking spaces would only exacerbate the issue. This decision seems short-sighted and fails to account for the practical needs of residents who rely on cars for transportation, especially in areas with limited public transport options. It's important to prioritize the convenience and safety of residents over the interests of developers.\n\nSURVEY:\nSupport Level (1-5): 1\nImpact – Housing (1-5): 3\nImpact – Transport (1-5): 4\nImpact – Community (1-5): 2\nKey Concerns: Parking availability, Transportation accessibility\nSuggested Improvements: Maintain minimum parking requirements, Improve public transport options",
