      "response": "NARRATIVE:\nRemoving minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi is a terrible idea. As a resident in this area, I know how congested the streets can get, especially during the peak summer months. Not having enough parking spaces will only make the situation worse, leading to more traffic jams and frustration for everyone. Additionally, many residents here rely on their cars for daily activities, such as grocery shopping or visiting family and friends. By removing these requirements, the council is disregarding the needs of the community and prioritizing developers over residents.\n\nSURVEY:\nSupport Level (1-5): 1\nImpact – Housing (1-5): 2\nImpact – Transport (1-5): 4\nImpact – Community (1-5): 3\nKey Concerns: Increased congestion, inconvenience for residents\nSuggested Improvements: Implement a balanced parking strategy that considers both developer interests and the needs of the community",
