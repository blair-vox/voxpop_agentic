      "response": "NARRATIVE:\nAs someone living in Bondi, I strongly support the proposal to remove minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments. Bondi is a bustling area with limited space, and reducing car spaces can encourage more sustainable transport options like walking, cycling, and public transport. This aligns with my strong beliefs in environmental protection and combating global warming. Furthermore, it can potentially lower housing costs as developers won't need to allocate space for parking, making living in Bondi more affordable for all residents.\n\nSURVEY:\nSupport Level (1-5): 5\nImpact – Housing (1-5): 4\nImpact – Transport (1-5): 5\nImpact – Community (1-5): 4\nKey Concerns: Environmental impact, Housing affordability\nSuggested Improvements: Ensure adequate infrastructure for alternative transport modes, such as bike lanes and improved public transport options.",
