While I can see the attraction for developers and perhaps some urban planners, I believe it's short-sighted and could lead to a range of issues. Primarily, it would likely exacerbate parking issues in an already congested area, negatively affecting both residents and visitors. Furthermore, not everyone can rely on public transport or cycling, particularly the elderly or those with mobility issues. Also, as we've learned from the pandemic, circumstances can change quickly and we have to be prepared. Today's 'unnecessary' car space could be tomorrow's necessity.",
