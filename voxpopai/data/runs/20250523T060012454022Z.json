  "area": null,
  "summary": "- The term \"synthetic users\" for AI personas is perceived as impersonal, dehumanizing, and lacking in individuality by multiple participants, who suggest alternative terms like \"simulated participants\" or \"virtual citizens\" for a more human-centered approach.\n- There is a consistent desire for terminology that values authenticity, inclusivity, and respect for individuality, reflecting concerns about detachment, lack of personalization, and dignity in language.\n- While some participants support the term \"synthetic users\" for its forward-thinking approach and acknowledgment of technological advancements, others emphasize the importance of accuracy, representation, and future applicability in AI personas.",
