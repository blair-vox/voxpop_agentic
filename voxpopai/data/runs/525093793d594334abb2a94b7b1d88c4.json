      "response": "NARRATIVE: From my perspective, I'm not particularly fond of the term 'synthetic users' for describing our AI focus group personas. It feels rather cold and distant, as if we're discussing objects rather than entities that are meant to embody the diversity and complexity of our society. I'd prefer a term that emphasises the human-like qualities of these personas, maybe 'simulated citizens' or 'virtual constituents'. After all, these AI personas are meant to reflect us, the people, in all our varied backgrounds and opinions, and I believe the terminology used should reflect that. SURVEY: Support Level (1-5): 2 Impact – Housing (1-5): 1 Impact – Transport (1-5): 1 Impact – Community (1-5): 3 Key Concerns: terminology dehumanises AI personas, lack of warmth and relatability in the term Suggested Improvements: adopt terms that emphasise human-like qualities of AI personas, such as 'simulated citizens' or 'virtual constituents'.",
