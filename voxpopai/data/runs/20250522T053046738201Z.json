      "response": "NARRATIVE:\nAs a resident in Randwick, I strongly oppose the proposal to remove minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi. This decision could lead to increased congestion in the area, making it harder for residents to find parking spaces. Additionally, not everyone in the community may be able to rely solely on public transport, especially those with mobility issues or families with young children. Ensuring adequate parking provisions is essential for maintaining the quality of life in the neighborhood and preventing additional stress on the existing infrastructure.\n\nSURVEY:\nSupport Level (1-5): 1\nImpact – Housing (1-5): 2\nImpact – Transport (1-5): 3\nImpact – Community (1-5): 4\nKey Concerns: Increased congestion, Accessibility for all residents\nSuggested Improvements: Maintain minimum parking requirements, Conduct thorough impact assessments on transport infrastructure.",
