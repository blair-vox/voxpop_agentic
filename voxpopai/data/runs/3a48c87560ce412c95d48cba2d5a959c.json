  "question": "Should Waverley Council implement a policy to eliminate minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi, allowing developers to build fewer or no car spaces based on residents' needs?",
  "area": null,
  "domain": "civic-policy",
  "summary": "- The most salient theme is the tension between environmental sustainability and concerns about parking availability and congestion in the community.\n- There is a conflict between the desire to reduce car dependency and the practical need for parking spaces, especially for residents who rely on their vehicles.\n- A surprising point is the varied emphasis on public transport infrastructure improvements as a suggested improvement, indicating differing views on the effectiveness of alternative transportation modes.",

        "narrative": "I'm inclined to oppose the proposal to eliminate minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi. I feel that this policy could lead to oversaturation of on-street parking, making it difficult for local residents who rely on their vehicles. Additionally, it might deter potential tenants with cars from moving into these apartments, which could impact the rental market. However, I understand the argument for reducing car dependence and encouraging use of public transport or walking. If implemented, the council should ensure adequate public transport services and infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists.",

I've seen enough to know that such a move would only exacerbate the already dire parking situation in the area.
