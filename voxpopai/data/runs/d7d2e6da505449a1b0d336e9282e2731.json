  "question": "Should Waverley Council implement a policy to eliminate minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi, allowing developers to build fewer or no car spaces based on residents' needs?",
  "area": null,
  "domain": "civic-policy",
  "summary": "- There is a clear division between those who support the proposal to eliminate minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi due to environmental concerns and those who oppose it citing practical issues like potential parking crunch and increased congestion.\n- The debate revolves around balancing environmental benefits with practical implications for residents, such as access to parking, impact on property values, and potential increase in on-street parking.\n- Support for the proposal often correlates with a belief in reducing car dependency, while opposition stems from concerns about the adequacy of public transport, developers' profit motives, and the impact on the local community.",
