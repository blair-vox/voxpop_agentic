  "area": null,
  "domain": "civic-policy",
  "summary": "- Strong division on the proposal to eliminate minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments, with one participant strongly opposing it due to concerns about increased congestion and property values.\n- Differing perspectives on the impact on transport infrastructure, with one participant highlighting potential negative effects of the proposal on traffic congestion while another sees it as an opportunity to reduce car dependency and improve public transport.\n- Varied viewpoints on the importance of car ownership and the impact on housing affordability, with one participant supporting the proposal to potentially increase the affordability of housing units by reducing unnecessary costs related to parking spaces.",
