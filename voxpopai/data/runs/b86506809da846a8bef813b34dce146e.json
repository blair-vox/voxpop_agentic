  "area": null,
  "domain": "civic-policy",
  "summary": "- The removal of minimum parking requirements for new developments in Waverley Council is a contentious issue, with strong opinions on both sides regarding the potential impact on parking availability, congestion, and property values.\n- Concerns about increased congestion and safety risks due to potential on-street parking are prevalent among residents opposed to the proposal, highlighting the importance of considering the community's well-being and infrastructure needs.\n- There is a clear divide in perspectives on the proposal based on environmental considerations and affordability versus concerns about practicality, convenience, and the impact on residents' daily lives.",
