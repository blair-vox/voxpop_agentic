  "area": null,
  "summary": "- Strong support for removing minimum parking requirements in Bondi to promote sustainable living and reduce congestion, particularly among residents valuing environmental sustainability and prioritizing alternative transport options like public transit and cycling.\n- Opposition to the removal of parking requirements centered around concerns of exacerbating existing parking congestion, impacting accessibility for residents with mobility issues, and potential overflow parking into surrounding suburbs, especially in areas already facing parking challenges like Bellevue Hill and Double Bay - Darling Point.\n- Emphasis on the need for adequate infrastructure for alternative transport options, comprehensive parking management plans, and conducting thorough impact assessments on transport infrastructure to address concerns raised by both supporters and opponents of the proposal.",
