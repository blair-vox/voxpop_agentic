Bondi is already congested, and reducing the number of car spaces can encourage residents to use more sustainable transport options like walking, cycling, or public transport. This aligns with our community's focus on the environment and reducing our carbon footprint. Plus, it can free up space for more green areas or amenities, making our neighborhood more livable and vibrant.\n\nSURVEY:\nSupport Level (1-5): 5\nImpact – Housing (1-5): 4\nImpact – Transport (1-5): 5\nImpact – Community (1-5): 4\nKey Concerns: Parking availability, Traffic congestion\nSuggested Improvements: Increase public transport options, Implement car-sharing programs",

Not everyone needs a car nowadays, especially in areas well-serviced by public transport like Bondi. By allowing developers to tailor parking provisions to suit residents' actual needs, we can encourage more sustainable living and reduce the strain on infrastructure. This change could also potentially lower construction costs, making housing more affordable in the long run.\n\nSURVEY:\nSupport Level (1-5): 4\nImpact – Housing (1-5): 4\nImpact – Transport (1-5): 3\nImpact – Community (1-5): 3\nKey Concerns: Housing affordability, Sustainable living\nSuggested Improvements: Ensure adequate public transport options, Implement car-sharing schemes",
