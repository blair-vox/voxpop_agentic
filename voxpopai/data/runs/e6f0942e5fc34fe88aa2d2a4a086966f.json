  "question": "Should Waverley Council implement a policy to eliminate minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi, allowing developers to build fewer or no car spaces based on residents' needs?",
  "area": null,
  "domain": "civic-policy",
  "summary": "- The primary conflict revolves around the balance between reducing car dependency for environmental reasons and ensuring adequate parking for residents who rely on personal transport.\n- There is a consistent concern about potential congestion and parking issues if minimum parking requirements are eliminated, impacting both residents and visitors.\n- The tension between prioritizing sustainable transport options and accommodating the diverse needs of residents, including the elderly or those with mobility issues, is evident in the responses.\n- The potential impact on housing prices and property values due to the lack of parking spaces is a recurring concern among the participants.",

As a resident who's been here for years, I've seen how the influx of people can greatly affect the availability of parking. It's already hard enough to find a spot, let alone if these new developments don't have enough spaces. This will cause a lot of inconvenience for the people, especially the elderly who can't walk far distances. Also, not everyone uses public transport or able to afford it.
