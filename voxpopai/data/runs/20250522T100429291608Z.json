  "question": "Waverley Council is considering a policy that would remove minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi. This means developers could build fewer or no car spaces if they believe it suits the residents' needs.",
  "area": null,
  "summary": "- Strong support for removing minimum parking requirements to promote sustainable urban living clashes with concerns about potential increase in traffic congestion and parking issues in congested areas like Bondi.\n- Differing perspectives on the impact of removing parking requirements are influenced by individual reliance on cars and environmental values.\n- Balancing housing affordability and transportation accessibility poses a challenge in urban development decisions.\n- Residents in already congested areas like Rose Bay - Vaucluse - Watsons Bay show significant opposition to the proposal, citing concerns about traffic congestion, parking availability, property values, and quality of life.\n- Recognition of changing resident needs towards sustainable transport options like public transport, cycling, and walking highlights a desire for policy changes reflecting evolving lifestyle choices.",
