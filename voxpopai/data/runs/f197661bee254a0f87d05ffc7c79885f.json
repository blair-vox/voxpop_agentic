  "area": null,

  "summary": "- The main conflict revolves around the balance between prioritizing environmental concerns and the practical needs of residents who rely on cars for various reasons.\n- There is a consistent concern about potential increases in traffic congestion and parking scarcity if minimum parking requirements are eliminated.\n- A surprising alignment between environmental consciousness and the support for the proposal, despite reservations about the practical implications for residents.",

I feel this could lead to more parking congestion in an already crowded area, which would be detrimental to the community. As a resident, I appreciate the peace that comes with a well-organised neighbourhood. Although I understand the need for affordable housing, I believe it should not compromise the quality of life for existing residents. Furthermore, without adequate parking, people may resort to using street parking, increasing congestion and potentially impacting emergency services access. My main concerns are the impact on the community and the local economy, as property values could also be affected.",

Even though I don't use transport much myself, I can see that it's going to cause problems for residents who do own cars. It could potentially increase the cost of living, as people would need to find and pay for offsite parking. Additionally, it could put a strain on public transportation if more people decide to go car-free due to lack of parking. While it might be good for the environment, I think it's important to balance that with the practical needs of the people in the community. Plus, I'm not sure if this is the best way to manage our local economy, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic impact still being felt.",
