Bondi is already so congested with traffic and limited parking spaces, so reducing the number of car spaces required for new buildings could actually help alleviate some of these issues. Plus, it would encourage more sustainable modes of transport like walking, cycling, or public transport, which aligns with my strong concern for the environment and reducing carbon emissions. I think this policy change would really benefit our community and make Bondi a more livable and eco-friendly place for everyone.\n\nSURVEY:\nSupport Level (1-5): 5\nImpact – Housing (1-5): 4\nImpact – Transport (1-5): 5\nImpact – Community (1-5): 4\nKey Concerns: Traffic congestion, Environmental impact\nSuggested Improvements: Ensure adequate infrastructure for alternative transport options such as bike lanes and public transport, Conduct regular reviews to assess the impact on parking availability and adjust policy accordingly.",
