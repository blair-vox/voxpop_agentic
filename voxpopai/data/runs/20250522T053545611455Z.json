      "response": "NARRATIVE:\nAs a retiree living in Bondi, I strongly oppose the proposal to remove minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments. Bondi already struggles with parking congestion, and removing these requirements would only make it harder for residents like me to find parking spaces near our homes. It's essential to consider the needs of the community, especially older residents who may rely on their cars for essential errands and medical appointments. This decision could significantly impact our quality of life and must be reconsidered.\n\nSURVEY:\nSupport Level (1-5): 1\nImpact – Housing (1-5): 3\nImpact – Transport (1-5): 4\nImpact – Community (1-5): 5\nKey Concerns: Parking congestion, Community needs\nSuggested Improvements: Maintain minimum parking requirements, Conduct thorough community consultations",
