  "question": "Should Waverley Council implement a policy to eliminate minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi, allowing developers to build fewer or no car spaces based on residents' needs?",
  "area": null,
  "domain": "civic-policy",
  "summary": "- There is a clear divide between those who support the proposal to eliminate minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi due to its potential benefits for housing affordability and the environment, and those who oppose it citing concerns about increased congestion, impact on property values, and local economy.\n- The conflict between the benefits of reducing car dependency for environmental reasons and the practical challenges such as parking availability, impact on public transport, and potential strain on existing infrastructure is evident in the responses.\n- The need for a balanced approach that considers the needs of both car owners and non-car owners, as well as the impact on local businesses, property values, and the quality of life for residents, is a recurring theme across the narratives.",
