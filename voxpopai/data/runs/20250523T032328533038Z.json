      "response": "NARRATIVE:\nAs a resident in Bondi, I strongly support the proposal to remove minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments. Bondi is already congested, and reducing the number of car spaces can encourage people to use alternative modes of transport like walking or cycling, which aligns with our community's focus on sustainability. Additionally, this can free up space for more green areas or community facilities, enhancing our overall quality of life.\n\nSURVEY:\nSupport Level (1-5): 5\nImpact – Housing (1-5): 4\nImpact – Transport (1-5): 5\nImpact – Community (1-5): 4\nKey Concerns: Traffic congestion, sustainability\nSuggested Improvements: Ensure sufficient infrastructure for alternative transport options",
