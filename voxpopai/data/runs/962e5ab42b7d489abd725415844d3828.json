While I understand the aim might be to reduce traffic and encourage more sustainable modes of transport, this could have serious impacts on those living in the area. Not all residents can manage without a car - we need to consider families, the elderly, and those who rely on their cars for work. Furthermore, it could lead to more cars being parked on already crowded streets, impacting the community negatively. Any move to reduce parking spaces needs to be balanced with improvements to public transport and more accessible options for those who can't do without a car.",
