      "response": "NARRATIVE:\nAs someone who values the environment greatly, I strongly support the proposal to remove minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi. Encouraging less car usage aligns with my belief in reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable living. Additionally, it could potentially lower housing costs by not requiring developers to allocate space for car parks, making living in Bondi more affordable for residents like me who are already burdened by mortgage payments. \n\nSURVEY:\nSupport Level (1-5): 5\nImpact – Housing (1-5): 4\nImpact – Transport (1-5): 5\nImpact – Community (1-5): 3\nKey Concerns: Environmental impact, Housing affordability\nSuggested Improvements: Ensure adequate alternative transport options, such as improved public transport and cycling infrastructure.",

      "response": "NARRATIVE:\nAs a resident in Paddington, I believe removing minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi is a progressive move that aligns with the changing needs of urban dwellers. With the increasing emphasis on public transport, cycling, and walkability in our city, dedicating less space to car parking can promote sustainable living and reduce congestion. Furthermore, this policy shift can potentially lower housing costs for residents as developers can allocate resources more efficiently, focusing on creating well-designed living spaces instead of mandatory parking spots that may go unused.\n\nSURVEY:\nSupport Level (1-5): 4\nImpact – Housing (1-5): 4\nImpact – Transport (1-5): 3\nImpact – Community (1-5): 4\nKey Concerns: Potential increase in street parking congestion, Accessibility for elderly residents\nSuggested Improvements: Ensure adequate alternative transport options, such as improved public transport services and infrastructure",
