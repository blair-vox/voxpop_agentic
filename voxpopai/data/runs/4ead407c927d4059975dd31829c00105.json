  "question": "Should Waverley Council eliminate minimum parking requirements for new apartment developments in Bondi to allow developers flexibility based on residents' needs?",
  "area": null,
  "domain": "civic-policy",
  "summary": "- There is a clear split between those who prioritize maintaining minimum parking requirements for new developments due to concerns about congestion and existing infrastructure strain versus those who support the proposal for its potential to increase housing affordability and promote sustainable living.\n- The potential impact on community character, property values, and quality of life emerges as a key concern for many residents, especially those who own property in the area.\n- The balance between developer flexibility and community needs is a recurring theme, with residents highlighting the importance of considering both economic benefits and the impact on daily life and local amenities.",
