Since I don't own a car, I rely heavily on public transport. Unfortunately, the housing costs are skyrocketing, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to make ends meet. I'm worried about the future of my kids and the kind of world they're going to grow up in. The local community is supportive, but it feels like our concerns are often overlooked by the government.
